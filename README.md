#### Mini Project - Loan Predictions, by Louis Rossi

## Hypothesis Generation**

Based on the schema/data details for this project, it is possible to derive a Hypothesis prior to exploring in python.

**Heavy features**
- All features except Loan_ID seem to be relevant to Loan_Status
- Married and combining income may help get approved
- Loan amount and applicant income may have high correlation
- Credit history is likely an important factor

**Features to note**
- Property areas with high growth potential may weigh in
- Educated individuals may have a higher rate of approval
- Self employed persons may have outlier potential; low income, high loan amount, poor credit history?
